I find finance to be a fascinating lens through which to view the world. The world runs on money (eat your heart out, Dunkin'), and by following where money goes - or doesn't go - you can learn a lot and stay informed on current events. 

As I learn more about money, I've enjoyed creating ways for myself to experiment in the market and work on my financial literacy and skills.
