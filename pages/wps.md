**Academics**: <br>


In the fall of my Senior year, I was accepted as an Early Decision applicant to <a href="/pages/neu/">Northeastern University</a>, and the rest is history!

**Extracurriculars**: <br>
My biggest commitment while in high school was performing arts. Woodside Priory was a very artistic school, and the theater department was no slouch. In both musicals and plays, from Shakespeare to Broadway, I rehearsed, sang, learned lines, and performed on stage for the members of the community. Acting is something that I attribute many of my major strengths to - I learned speech tactics and improved my verbal skills, honed my memory, and lost any fear of speaking to groups or being a leader, whether on the stage or off it. 

I was also the scouting head on Priory's student-led <a href="https://www.team751.com/">FIRST Robotics team</a>, working primarily on data and logistics. We competed annually in competitions with powerhouse teams such as Nueva, and had a blast geeking out about programming, learning to weld, carefully managing our snack supplies, and arguing about who had bad taste in lab music. 

Tennis has always been the sport that I've taken to the most readily (since I was a toddler!), and I joined the tennis team with verve and vigor, rising to the first singles seed in my freshman year. That's not necessarily a boast as to my skill level, though, as we were pretty terrible. Still, it was a great way to stay active and work on a favorite sport of mine.
