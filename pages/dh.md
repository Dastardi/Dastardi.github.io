title: Distilled Harmony
subtitle: A cornerstone of life at Northeastern

In the fall of my sophomore year, I auditioned and was accepted as a bass to one of the most amazing a cappella groups in Boston, Distilled Harmony. Since then we've released multiple EPs, competed in performances across New England, been on retreats to Massachusetts and Maine, performed at a conference in Orlando, and had an all-around great time. 

DH is one of the most important parts of my college experience, in part because of the amazing music but mostly because of the people. We're a tight-knit group of people who love to have fun and learn together, and I can think of few things more valuable to have in your life.
