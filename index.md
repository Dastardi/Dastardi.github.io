### Who am I?
I'm a 20-year old computer science and philosophy student at Northeastern University. When I'm not studying or working I write music, play frisbee, and read just about anything I can get my hands on. I love to travel, and take every opportunity I can to go somewhere new!


### What do I do?
My academic focus is in advanced logic, game theory, and machine learning. I'm experienced with Python and Java, and know how to effectively use frameworks such as PyTorch for AI applications. I have hands-on experience writing technical reports, business briefings, and research papers. 

Outside of school I have multiple years of experience in early-stage venture capital, and I'm an experienced project manager and people wrangler. I regularly attend hackathons and business conventions such as OutsideLLMs in San Francisco and Harvard Business School's annual VC/PE conference. 

I also have experience programming in Unity, making and editing music with Logic Pro, and working as a prompt engineer. I love to learn, and find that expanding my tech toolbox is always worthwhile. 

### Where can you find me?
I grew up in Palo Alto, California, but at the moment I'm living and studying in Boston and just spending my breaks and summers back in the Bay. That being said, though, I never really know where I'll find myself next!

Online, I can be found at any of the links below - LinkedIn and Instagram are my primary pathways into the world wide web. I keep up with my email pretty consistently, so if you're looking to get in touch, that's the place to do it!
