### Who am I?
I'm a 20-year old junior at Northeastern University with a love for interesting technologies.

My current academic focus is computer science and philosophy, but I've spent time in economics, psychology, and game theory. Professionally, I've worked in venture capital and at startups making market maps, running events, undertaking research projects, attending pitch meetings, and more.

Raised in Palo Alto as the oldest of four boys, I'm someone with a high level of independence and an eye for excellence. I believe there's little point in working towards a goal if you're not giving it your full effort, and bring that spirit to everything I do.
