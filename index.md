### Who am I?
I'm a 21-year old senior at Northeastern University with a love for interesting technologies and a penchant for asking good questions. 

My current academic focus is computer science and philosophy with a focus on artificial intelligence, but I've spent time in economics, psychology, and game theory. Professionally, I've held a number of roles. I've done data science for a large corporation, working on Google ad bidding and AI workforce integration. I've worked at a small venture capital firm making market maps, running events, leading research projects, attending pitch meetings, and more. I've coordinated AI hackathons and other events in San Francisco with a couple different startups, and have developed a habit of rapidly ramping up my responsiility and trust via consistent and effective work. 

On a personal level, I have a similarly wide range of interests. I read AI/ML papers and sci-fi novels, make and listen to copious amounts of music, cook and bake, and play a number of different sports.

Raised in Palo Alto as the oldest of four boys, I'm someone with a high level of independence and an eye for excellence. I believe there's little point in working towards a goal if not giving it my full effort, and bring that spirit to everything I do.

This website is still (and it's looking like it always will be) a work in progress! For any specific info I'd direct you to <u><a href="/assets/files/resume.pdf" target="blank">my resume</a></u> or, of course, to <u><a href="mailto:lukescurrier@gmail.com" target="blank">just asking me</a></u>. That being said, I'm in the process of populating it with anecdotes, details on my personal and professional endeavors, and more insights into who I am and what I do. Come back soon if you don't find what you're looking for and I'm sure I'll have something new for you to check out!
