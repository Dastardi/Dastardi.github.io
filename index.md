### Who am I?
I'm a 20-year old junior at Northeastern University with a love for interesting technologies. I like to ask "how" questions - how is wealth created? How do people make decisions? How do you make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich?

My current academic focus is computer science and philosophy, but I've spent time in economics, psychology, and game theory. Professionally, I've worked in venture capital and at startups making market maps, running events, leading research projects, attending pitch meetings, and more. I like to code and I like weird probability math, hobbies which might seem to clash with my love of sci-fi and fantasy novels and my affinity for music, but hey - here we are.

Raised in Palo Alto as the oldest of four boys, I'm someone with a high level of independence and an eye for excellence. I believe there's little point in working towards a goal if not giving it my full effort, and bring that spirit to everything I do.

If you're here, you're likely in one of two camps - either you're curious about hiring me or you found me online somewhere and had your interest piqued. Anyone outside of those categories likely accidentally typed my url into the search bar, and if so, buy a lottery ticket - the chances of that happening were 1 in a number with 30 digits. 

Right now, there's not a lot you can learn on here that you can't learn from <u><a href="/assets/files/resume.pdf" target="blank">my resume</a></u> or from <u><a href="mailto:lukescurrier@gmail.com" target="blank">asking me</a></u> - this website is still a work in progress! That being said, I'm in the process of populating it with anecdotes, details on my personal and professional endeavors, and more insights into who I am and what I do. Come back soon and I'm sure I'll have something interesting for you to check out. 

Take care and I'll see you out there.
