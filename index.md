### Who am I?
I'm a 20-year old computer science and philosophy student at Northeastern university. When I'm not studying or working I write music, play frisbee, and read just about anything I can get my hands on. 




### What do I do?
My academic focus is in advanced logic, game theory, and machine learning. Outside of school I have multiple years of experience in early-stage venture capital, and I'm an experienced project manager and people wrangler.
