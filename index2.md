### Who am I?
I'm a junior at Northeastern University with a love for creative projects and a habit of saying yes to anything and everything. 

I'm currently studying computer science and philosophy but have dabbled in game theory, music, psychology, and economics - a hobby of mine is picking up lifetime skills, and what better place to do so than college? In my spare time I sing, play sports, travel, and spend time working on my many [side quests](/projects). 

Professionally, I've developed a habit of finding interesting early-stage companies and joining them on their respective journies. In the last two years I've joined LearnPrompting as a content creator and became one of six founding advisors, managed projects and community development for Boom Capital, ran hackathons with Doppler, and interfaced with all sorts of people in the tech world during my summers in San Francisco. 

Raised in Palo Alto as the oldest of four boys, I'm someome with a high level of independence and an eye for excellence - I believe there's little point in working towards a goal if you're not giving it your full effort. That being said, Alfred Pareto was a smart cookie. Know your 20% and the rest will come.
