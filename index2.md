### Who am I?
I'm a junior at Northeastern University with a love for investing in new technologies and a habit of saying yes to life.

My current focus academically is computer science and philosophy but I've spent time in economics, psychology, and game theory. Professionally I've worked in venture capital and at startups making market maps, running events, undertaking research projects, attending pitch meetings, and more.

Raised in Palo Alto as the oldest of four boys, I'm someone with a high level of independence and an eye for excellence. I believe there's little point in working towards a goal if you're not giving it your full effort. That being said, though, Alfred Pareto was a smart cookie. If you want to learn more about what I do and how I think, read on!
